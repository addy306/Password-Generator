<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project I create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. The shades of Blue and white combination makes the UI more appealing to users.
