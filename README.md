<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project analyzes the financial records of a company with Javascript. 
I calculated each of the following below :

- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- Tracked what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then found the average.

- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.-

After all the calculations, I console logged all results. The result can be viewed ;
- By right clicking on the browser(deployed website) .
- Click on inspect
- Click on console at the bottom and the result of the calculations will be revealed.
